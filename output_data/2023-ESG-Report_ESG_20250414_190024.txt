Based on the provided 2023 ESG Report of Trane Technologies, I will evaluate their compliance with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards.

**Environmental (E) Compliance:**

1. **Energy Efficiency:** The company reports that approximately 25% of its products and revenue contribute to the clean energy transition, which is an increase from previous years. Additionally, they mention that 17% of their revenue comes from products that meet ENERGY STAR efficiency metrics for Residential Furnaces and Central Air-conditioners and Heat Pumps.
2. **Emissions Reduction:** The report highlights a reduction in empty truck miles driven through the Dedicated Carrier Program (16% to 87%) and emissions avoided through this program (1,895 to 2,553 metric tons CO2e). This indicates a commitment to reducing emissions from their logistics operations.

**Social (S) Compliance:**

1. **Employee Welfare:** There is no specific information provided in the report regarding employee welfare or labor practices.
2. **Supplier Engagement:** The company reports an increase in the number of suppliers across the globe, and 100% of preferred suppliers are enrolled in their ESG reporting platform. They also mention a reduction in supplier risk through On-Site Assessment (OSA) audits.

**Governance (G) Compliance:**

1. **Board Transparency:** There is no specific information provided in the report regarding board transparency or composition.
2. **Innovation and R&D:** The company reports an increase in average revenue from innovation (18.6% to 26.9%) and a significant amount of research and development expense (from $165 million to $252 million). This suggests a commitment to innovation and R&D.

**ESG Compliance Assessment:**

Based on the provided report, Trane Technologies demonstrates a moderate level of ESG compliance in environmental and governance areas. They show progress in reducing emissions from their logistics operations and increasing revenue from energy-efficient products. However, they could improve by providing more information on employee welfare, labor practices, and board transparency.

To further assess ESG compliance, additional questions would be helpful:

1. What specific initiatives have been implemented to reduce emissions from their manufacturing operations?
2. How does the company engage with its employees on ESG-related issues, such as training or community involvement programs?
3. Are there any independent directors on the board with ESG expertise?

Please provide more information if available, and I will be happy to continue evaluating Trane Technologies' ESG compliance.
